                                	Budgeting and managing your cash flow are flip sides of the same coin. Both essentially revolve around planning for what lies ahead in your financial future. The starting point always involves a good, thorough budget, which includes the side-by-side comparison of income and expenses. Once a solid budget is in place, managing your cash flow is really just a matter of setting aside any extra money you have in some months to help cover the shortfalls you'll have in others. Budgeting and managing your cash flow are highly personalized decisions, so you'll have to think about what you need, what your values are, and what you're good at (or not so good at) in order to come up with a plan that works best for you.

                                	Generally speaking, when it comes to meeting your future financial objectives, you'll need three things: time, discipline, and knowledge. Interestingly, most people believe the most important of those three is knowledge, when in fact it is undoubtedly time. The more time you have to meet your financial goals, the easier they will be to attain. The less time you have to meet your financial goals, the harder they will be to attain. A little bit of knowledge, an ounce of discipline, and a whole lot of time can accomplish just about any financial objective.

                                	There are generally two kinds of debt: good debt and bad debt.  Good debt can be interpreted as things like mortgages, student loans, or even car notes.  For many individuals, these are necessary evils that must be shouldered in order to reach higher goals in life.  Bad debt, on the other hand, generally centers around credit card debt.  A rough cutoff point between good debt and bad debt is 6%.  If you're paying an annual rate of 6% or less on the debt, that's pretty "good."  Anything significantly over 6%, and definitely anything in double digits, is pretty "bad." Understanding how to manage or minimize debt throughout your life is critical to financial stability.

                                	The concept behind insurance is to spread risk across a pool of individuals with similar needs. Each person in the pool pays a price (typically called a premium) to the insurance company for the right to obtain coverage in the event of an accident, theft, illness, death, etc. At any given time, most of the individuals in the pool will not actually "need" their insurance, and the insurance company will get to keep the premiums they've collected from those individuals. But those premiums are essentially used by the insurance company to subsidize the unlucky few who do "use" their insurance policies and file a claim. Ironically, the hope of everyone who carries insurance in any capacity is that they'll never have to use it.

                                	Our Government, including the federal, state and local authorities, rely on taxes to provide for the welfare of all Americans. Our taxes help pay for services such as the military, social security, roads, libraries, airports, food and product safety andâ€¦education. There are many types of taxes; including tax on our income from wages, interest and dividends. Even corporations pay income tax. There are extra taxes on luxury goods, tobacco products, alcohol, fuel and imported goods. We also pay taxes on our earnings to the State and local governments, property taxes our homes and vehicles and sales taxes on many of the items we buy every day. In terms of history, the Federal Government of the United States began taxing individual income in the early 1860s. In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution made income taxes a permanent part of how the Federal Government raises funds to meet its obligations. Of course, what gets taxed and for what purpose are always points of heated debate in our community. This is in some way why taxes are so complicated.

                                	Welcome to Winthrop! We want your first year financial experience to be a positive one. Here are some important things to remember when it comes to managing your money as you settle into life as a college student.
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    After your tuition, room and board, fees, etc. are all paid, you're likely to have some income left over. This might come from the Hope Scholarship, Life Scholarship, a work study program, an off-campus job, or maybe your parents. Once you have these discretionary funds in your possession, you need to be smart about how you're going to allocate them throughout the semester.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>   
                                    Remember, budgeting is a subjective process that will vary from one person to the next. From cell phones to getting your hair done, a "necessity" to one person might be something another person is willing to forgo. Every dollar has a job, and you determine what that job is.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    By focusing on your income and expenses at this early stage in your life, you're setting yourself up for a lifetime of smart, savvy financial decision making. Lastly, credit cards can be an extremely useful tool, but they can also establish dangerous and destructive habits. Until you're ready to commit to understanding all the ins and outs of responsibly managing credit, these are best left for a future project.
